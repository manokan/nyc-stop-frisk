## NYC's Stop and Frisk

This a challenging public dataset to clean, parse, and visualize. I hope to do that in some detail. The first port of call, if you will, is my blog at [DataTellsMe.com](https://datatellsme.com) from where I will be regularly updating this repo. 

StopFrisk_process_rawData.R contains the link for downloading the raw data and code for doing basic processing. The processed file, at ~4.2GB is too large to host here or elsewhere costlessly. Each of the folders, however, contains a CSV file of the subsetted/computed data needed for that visualization.
